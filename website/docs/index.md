<br>
Fiddler is a stream processor built in rust that uses a yaml based configuration file syntax to map together inputs, processors, and outputs. Fiddler takes a module approach to inputs, processors, and outputs allowing users to take advantage of incremental releases of new modules or develop their own to run within the fiddler runtime.  Whether you are looking to utilize fiddler for it's processing capabilities through the CLI or integrate directly in your own applications, head over to our [Documentation](https://rc1405.github.io/fiddler/latest) to get started.
